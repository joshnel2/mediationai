# CreateDisputeView Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Missing State Variables
- **Problem**: `isProcessingPayment` was referenced but not declared
- **Fix**: Added `@State private var isProcessingPayment = false`
- **Impact**: Enables proper payment processing state management

### 2. Missing Environment Object
- **Problem**: `purchaseService` was referenced but not injected
- **Fix**: Added `@EnvironmentObject var purchaseService: InAppPurchaseService`
- **Impact**: Enables access to in-app purchase functionality

### 3. Missing Dependency Injection
- **Problem**: `InAppPurchaseService` was not provided in the app's environment
- **Fix**: Added `@StateObject var purchaseService = InAppPurchaseService()` to `MediationAIApp.swift`

- **Impact**: Ensures proper dependency injection throughout the app

### 4. Malformed Pricing Card Section
