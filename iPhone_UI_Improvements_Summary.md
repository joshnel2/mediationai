# iPhone UI Improvements & Text Fixes Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive improvements to the MediationAI app to optimize for iPhone screens and fix text visibility issues. All changes maintain the professional design while making the app more user-friendly and accessible.

## Text Shortening for iPhone Screens

### Onboarding Screen Improvements
- **Traditional Lawyers**: "Thousands of dollars" → "Thousands"
- **Court System**: "Months to years" → "Years"
- **Our AI**: "Minutes to hours" → "Minutes"  
- **Biased Process**: "Biased Process" → "Biased"
- **Fair AI**: "Fair AI" → "Unbiased", "Unbiased analysis" → "Fair AI"

These changes make the comparison cards more readable on iPhone screens while maintaining the core message.

## Home Page Button Overhaul

### Community Buttons → Contract & Escrow
- **First Button**: Changed from "Community" to "Contract"
  - Icon: `person.3.fill` → `doc.text.fill`

  - Icon: `person.3.fill` → `lock.shield.fill`
  - Description: "Coming soon"
  - Disabled action (coming soon feature)

## New Contract System

### ContractView Creation
Created a comprehensive new view (`contractview.swift`) that explains:

- **Contract Features**: Fair terms, legal language, digital signatures, secure storage
- **Legal Standing**: Court enforceability, legal compliance, fair & balanced terms
- **User Guide**: Clear instructions on how to use the contract system

Added three checkbox options to the create dispute flow:

1. **Create Contract** ✅
   - "AI will create a fair contract for this dispute"
   - Toggleable checkbox with green checkmark

2. **Request Signatures** ✅
   - "Contract will be legally binding in court"
   - Toggleable checkbox with green checkmark

3. **Escrow Service** ⚫ (Grayed out)

## Text Visibility Fixes
