# MediationAI iOS App

## 🏗️ Project Setup Status: FIXED ✅

Your MediationAI iOS app project has been successfully organized and fixed! Here's what was done:

### ✅ Issues Fixed:

1. **Project Structure**: Created proper Xcode project structure with `MediationAI.xcodeproj`
2. **File Organization**: Moved all Swift files into the `MediationAI/` directory
3. **Asset Catalog**: Created complete asset catalog with all required colors:
   - Primary: #6C47FF (Purple)
   - Secondary: #FFB800 (Orange/Yellow) 
   - Background: #F7F7FB (Light Gray)
   - Accent: #00D2FF (Cyan)
4. **File Naming**: Fixed filename inconsistencies (`meidationaiapp.swift` → `MediationAIApp.swift`)
